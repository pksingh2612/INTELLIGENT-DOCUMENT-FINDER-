About this challenge, how easy do you find it to remember the exact location of a presentation that you created last year? Not very easy, right? We deal with hundreds of documents daily and forget about them some time down the line. But what if we want that old presentation again for our your work, but unfortunately you do not remember the name or content of that document to retrieve it from the large storage of your computer. In such cases, we make use of a document finder, which can search for the document of our need based on a query input. This will not only help in faster access to the document, but will also help in grouping similar documents together and in analysing them.

# Stakeholder

# Problem Statement

#### Intelligent Document Finder
We are looking for an Intelligent Document Finder tool that can provide easy and intelligent searches among the document files. The required document type includes presentations, pdf, doc and txt files. The main idea behind this problem statement is combining human tagging with an automated semantic search for efficient document finding. The tool is supposed to have manual as well as auto tagging capabilities. Once the documents are tagged, the user will enter a few queries in the search page of the tool to look for the most relevant documents.
