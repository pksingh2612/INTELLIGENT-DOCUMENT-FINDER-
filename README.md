# INTELLIGENT DOCUMENT FINDER 
 an Intelligent Document Finder tool that can provide easy and intelligent searches among the document files. The required document type includes presentations, pdf, doc and txt files. The main idea behind this problem statement is combining human tagging with an automated semantic search for efficient document finding. The tool is supposed to have manual as well as auto tagging capabilities. Once the documents are tagged, the user will enter a few queries in the search page of the tool to look for the most relevant documents.
